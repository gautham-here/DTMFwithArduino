# DTMFwithArduino

The objective of this project is to design and implement a home automation system utilizing a Dual-Tone Multi-Frequency (DTMF) decoder. This project enables users to remotely control home appliances using DTMF tones generated by a mobile phone. The system will be further analysed using MATLAB simulations at the end to validate the processing and highlight the functionality of the DTMF decoder.
